# Description : Write a program that takes input from a list of [0,7] and makes pairs from the output [A,H], from the pairs determines if its a function and if it is if it is a one-to-one, onto, or both
# Collaborators: None

input_ = input('Enter your input pairs in the form\n (4,F)(5,G)(4,H)\n The inputs are a list of mappings of elements from set [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] to the elements of set [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H]\n 1 ≤ Number of pairs in input ≤ 16')
